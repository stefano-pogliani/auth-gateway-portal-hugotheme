# AuthGateway Portal

[Hugo] theme to quickly create application catalogues.
In this context, an application catalogue is a simple web page to collect references to other
web applications.

This provides a single known location useful to then reach out to many other links/tools.
While all items in a catalogue generally have a common thread, that does not have to be the case.

The AuthGateway Portal theme are great for creating a "one link to rule them all" page for
homes and small busnesses.
When combined with [AuthGateway] you can have a secured collection of locally or remotely
accessible tools at your fingertips.

Intended to be used in combination with the [AuthGateway] authentication proxy.
This theme can also be used independendly.
